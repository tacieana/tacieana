# Hey there! I'm Taciana 🌷

**Software Engineer | Java Enthusiast | Problem Solver**  

I love **writing clean, efficient, and scalable code**—whether it's designing robust backend architectures, optimizing performance, or diving into **Design Patterns** just for fun. I have a special interest in **high-performance systems, distributed architectures, and problem-solving** (yes, LeetCode challenges included!).  

### 🔍 What you'll find here:  
- ⚡ Hands-on projects with **Design Patterns and Software Architecture**  
- 🔗 Experiments with **Java, Quarkus, Angular, and more**  
- 📡 Playing around with **event-driven systems, messaging queues, and scalable architectures**  
- 🛠️ A bit of **DevOps**, a lot of **system design**, and endless curiosity for how things work under the hood  

### 🌱 Currently exploring:  
I'm **diving into blockchain development**, understanding how it differs from traditional web programming, and exploring its real-world applications.  

📬 **Let’s connect!** Feel free to explore my repos and reach out. 🚀
